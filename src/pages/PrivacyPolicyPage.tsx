        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Local Storage</b>: Local storage is a technology that allows a website or application

    <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
    <p>
      Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a concept promoted by certain regulatory authorities and industry
      groups for development and implementation of a mechanism that would allow internet users to
      control the tracking of their online activities across websites. Currently, various browsers
      (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that allows a user to
      set a preference in the browser to not have his/her activities on the internet tracked. You
      can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences. When a user’s
      browser is set to DNT, some cookies and other tracking technologies may become inactive,
      depending on how the website visited responds to DNT browser settings. If that occurs, the
      website visited will not recognize you upon return to that website, save your passwords or
      user names, and some other features of a website may become unavailable or not function
      properly.

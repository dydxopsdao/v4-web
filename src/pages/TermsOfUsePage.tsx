      permission of Company or Company’s licensors, as applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Open-Source Software and Certain Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Services use open-source software (“dYdX Software”) developed by dYdX Trading Inc. 
      (the "Software Developer"), which is independent from and unaffiliated with Company. 
      Any use of dYdX Software is subject to the terms and conditions available at 
      https://dydx.exchange/v4-terms (the “dYdX Software Terms”). In accordance with section 4 of 
      the dYdX Software Terms, the terms and conditions of Annex A (Risks Associated with 
      Perpetual Contracts), Annex B (MegaVault Terms), Annex C (Affiliate Feature Terms) and 
      Annex D (Instant Market Listing Terms) of the dYdX Software Terms are set forth below in 
      substance. By using any of the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you are bound by, 
      and will use the Services in compliance with, these Terms of Use and the dYdX Software Terms.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks Associated with Perpetual Contracts</h3>
    <p>
      By using the Services to enter into perpetual contracts, you understand and agree that 
      you expressly assume the following risks:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use of the Services in particular for entering into perpetual contracts carries 
          significant financial risk. Digital Assets, especially in connection with perpetual 
          contracts, are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions 
          entered into using the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You 
          acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services at your own risk. The risk 
          of loss in trading Digital Assets, especially entering into perpetual contracts, can be 
          substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable 
          for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you 
          represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making 
          your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and 
          the underlying Digital Assets, including perpetual contracts. You represent that you have 
          sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make 
          your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with 
          the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, 
          including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All 
          transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms of Use, 
          we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you for 
          any loss or injury sustained by you or any third parties in connection with, your use of 
          the Services for performing Digital Asset transactions, including entering into perpetual 
          contracts.
        </li>
        <li>
          You understand and accept the risks and potential for loss of funds arising from the 
          underlying mechanics of perpetual contracts, the dYdX Software and the Services; 
          including, without limitation, (a) the risk of positions forcibly being liquidated due to 
          insufficient collateral, (b) the risk of losses from payment of funding rates, (c) the 
          risk of loss as a result of protocol deleveraging mechanisms, including that your 
          expected trading returns could be reduced to offset under-collateralized positions of 
          other traders; (d) risks arising from disruption of trading activities due to exchange 
          issues such as downtime, technical glitches or hacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          You understand that dYdX Software and the Services remains under development, which 
          creates technological, trading and other risks when using the Services. These risks include, 
          without limitation, delays in trades, withdrawals and deposits resulting from errors in 
          dYdX Software and the Services, our servers being offline, or our software deployment 
          being out of date or incorrectly configured. You acknowledge that these risks may have a 
          material impact on your transactions using the Services, which may result in, among other 
          things, failing to fulfill transactions at your desired price or at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          You understand that you are responsible for all trades you place, including any erroneous 
          orders that may be filled. No action will be taken to resolve erroneous trades that result 
          from your errors.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>MegaVault</h3>
    <h4><strong>
      By choosing to use MegaVault via the Services ("MegaVault") you agree that deposited 
      assets will be used to support liquidity on the dYdX Chain protocol; you are not relying on 
      any publicly described annual percentage rate ("APR") or other expectation of profit to 
      induce your deposit. You understand that MegaVault is a liquidity provider and trades based 
      on pre-configured algorithms.
    </strong></h4>
    
    <p>
      You understand that any assets deposited to MegaVault will be allocated so as to support 
      dYdX Chain protocol liquidity, and may not maximize trading returns. Any APR shown is an 
      estimate and provided for informational purposes only and could vary significantly. 
      MegaVault has no investment track record, and any historical performance is not indicative 
      of future performance, or actual results.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We and the Software Developer do not make any representations or warranties on the accuracy, 
      reliability or completeness of any public representations related to MegaVault, and do not 
      accept any liability for any loss (whether direct or indirect) arising from public 
      representations of APR.
    </p>

      There is material risk of economic loss by using MegaVault and no return is 
      guaranteed. You are solely responsible for any loss or liability from using MegaVault. 
      MegaVault provides liquidity in highly illiquid and volatile markets and you may 
      experience material slippage (difference between what you expect to receive and actual 
      outcome on withdrawal) on withdrawal. 
    </p>
    
    <h4><strong>
      By choosing to use MegaVault you agree that we and the Software Developer are not 
      responsible for your losses and MegaVault relies on experimental open source software.

          operates without oversight and is subject to errors that can cause MegaVault to 
          malfunction (including, without limitation, coding errors and security vulnerabilities). 
        </li>
        <li>
          not responsible for any losses that result from software “bugs” or “hacks” of MegaVault;
        </li>
        <li>
          do not select the market specific “sub-vaults” to which deposits are allocated; and 
        </li>

          deposits into MegaVault are not covered by any investor protection funds.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that (a) MegaVault is based on experimental open-source software, 
      which includes the use of automated smart contracts and trading algorithms which may 
      yield unpredictable results in live markets; and (b) you have, together with your advisors, 
      researched the “sub-vaults” and the risks (including, without limitaton, volatility,

      Developer.
    </strong></h4>
    
    <p>
      You have made your own independent decision to deposit into MegaVault, based on advice 
      from any advisors you deem necessary. You have, together with your advisors, researched 
      the other uses or sources of earnings for your Digital Assets (including, without limitation, 
      staking with a validator, and depositing with a centralized exchange to earn yield) 
      before opting to participate in MegaVault.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You have conducted your own research and consulted a qualified professional to advise you 
      on the legality, regulatory compliance, tax treatment, investment and financial suitability 
      of MegaVault as it applies to you, in your jurisdiction, and for your purposes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You are not relying on any communication (written or oral) from us, the Software Developer, 
      or any other persons as investment advice or as a recommendation to make a deposit in 
      MegaVault. Any information provided related to the operations of MegaVault were not 
      considered investment advice or a recommendation to make deposits in MegaVault. We 
      and the Software Developer do not act as a fiduciary or advisor to you in respect of 
      your decision to deposit any Digital Assets into MegaVault.
    </p>
    
    <h4><strong>
      By choosing to use MegaVault, you agree that an operator (the "Operator"), which is 
      independent from and unaffiliated with Company, controls MegaVault.
    </strong></h4>

      You understand that the Operator was not selected by us or the Software Developer.

      will be selected by a governance community vote available <a href="https://dydx.forum/t/proposal-to-set-greave-as-the-dydx-megavault-operator/3129/2">here</a>. 
      The Operator has little or no operating history and you should not place undue reliance on 
      the community vote. You should independently review the Operator and determine if it is a 
      suitable party to manage MegaVault. We and the Software Developer are not responsible 
      for the actions of the Operator.

    <h3>Instant Market Listings</h3>
    <h4><strong>
      By using the instant market listing feature via the Services (“Instant Listing”), 
      you agree that that to create an Instant Listing, you have to make a large deposit 
      that is subject to a long lock-up period with a material risk of loss and 
      no guaranteed return.
    </strong></h4>
    
    <p>
      The large deposit you make to create an Instant Listing of a market has no guaranteed 
      return and is subject to a long lock-up period and material risk of loss. The deposit 
      you make does not solely support liquidity for the market you listed. The deposit 
      supports liquidity for all markets on the dYdX Chain protocol. The deposit you make 
      will be deposited into MegaVault which is operated by the Operator 
      in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. MegaVault provides 
      liquidity in highly illiquid and volatile markets, and you may experience material 
      slippage (which is the difference between what you expect to receive and the actual outcome 
      on withdrawal) on withdrawal.
    </p>
    
    <h4><strong>
      By using Instant Listing, you agree that you have no relationship with us or the 
      Software Developer, and are not listing markets for the foregoing. You have made an 
      independent decision to list a market.
    </strong></h4>
    
    <p>
      Using Instant Listing does not create any contractual, partnership, fiduciary, sales, 
      franchise, agency, representative, contractor, employment or other relationship between 
      you, and Company or the Software Developer. You have made your own independent decision 
      to instant list a market using Instant Listing. You are not listing markets for us 
      or the Software Developer. You have not relied on any communication (written or oral) 
      from us or the Software Developer as advice or a recommendation to list a market 
      using Instant Listing.
    </p>
    
    <h4><strong>
      By using Instant Listing, you agree that you are responsible for compliance with applicable 
      law and indemnifying Company and the Software Developer for any losses as a result of 
      your failure to comply with applicable laws.

      your actions comply with all applicable laws and do not violate the rights of any other

      about jurisdictions in which Instant Listing is appropriate, and you are 
      strongly encouraged to review all applicable laws prior to using Instant Listing.

      any given time, and we are under no obligation to update such material.
    </p>

    <h2>Blockchain Transactions and Exchange of Crypto Assets</h2>
    <p>
      The Services allow you access to on-chain protocols or other methods of transacting in Digital
      Assets. That functionality is not provided by Company, and we do not control it. Our Services
      make such functionalities accessible only as a convenience to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You understand that we do not hold your Digital Assets, and take no custody of them. We have
      no access to your assets or funds. It is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain
      control of your Digital Assets and you have sole responsibility for exchanging them (including
      through the Services).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any losses you suffer as a result of your crypto asset transactions and exchanges is your
      responsibility and you hereby indemnify us, agree to defend us, and hold us harmless against
      any claims or losses that you or anyone else suffer as a result of your crypto asset
      transactions, even if you initiated your transaction by accessing our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also understand that, by using the Services, you may be interacting with other third
      parties that are independent from and unaffiliated with us. In particular, you understand and
      acknowledge that, in order to successfully interact with on-chain protocols and transact in
      Digital Assets via our Services, you will need to rely on services provided by third parties,
      including (but not limited to) remote procedure call node (“RPC node”) operators. An
      RPC node is a type of computer server that allows users to read data from and send
      transactions to a blockchain network. We do not operate any RPC nodes and are not responsible
      for the operation of any RPC nodes required for your successful interaction with on-chain
      protocols or transacting in Digital Assets. Any RPC nodes that you rely on or use are
      independent from and unaffiliated with Company and Company shall not be held liable for the
      operation of any RPC nodes or the function or service to be performed by those RPC nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also understand that we do not act as your financial advisors or give you any investment
      advice of any kind with respect to your use or exchange of Digital Assets. As with any trading
      activities, it is your responsibility and you are solely responsible for the contents of your
      wallet, your exchange decisions, how and when you trade Digital Assets and with whom. It is
      also your responsibility to ensure you understand crypto assets, how they work, what their
      value is, and how to trade such assets, as there are significant risks in doing so, all of
      which you solely assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that the time of a Digital Asset transaction can affect the value of the asset
      or the fees associated with a transaction or both. You hereby agree that you hold us harmless
      against any and all claims arising from the transactions of your Digital Assets, or the timing
      of such transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digital Assets are not subject to deposit and/or securities insurance or protection regimes.
      Company is not a bank, and we have no fiduciary duty to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Services may be subject to expropriation and/or theft. Hackers or other malicious actors
      may attempt to interfere with our Services or your use thereof in a variety of ways,
      including, but not limited to, use of Malicious Code, denial of service attacks, Sybil
      attacks, and spoofing. Furthermore, because much of our Services rely on open-source software,
      there is the software underlying our code that may contain bugs or weaknesses which may
      negatively affect the Services, or result in the loss of your Digital Assets, or your ability
      to control your wallet. You hold us harmless from and against any losses you suffer as a
      result of such issues.
    </p>
    <p>

      components and you agree that your use of the Services are subject to, and you will comply

      All decisions you make based on information provided through the Services are your sole
      responsibility and you hold us harmless from and against any losses you suffer as a result of
      such decisions. The Services provide access to materials and tools offered by or created by
      third parties, such as Digital Asset protocols or smart contracts. We do not control such
      materials, and provide no guarantee as to their accuracy, completeness, legality or
      usefulness. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any aspect of the
      information, content, or services contained in any such third-party materials comprising the
      backend of, or accessible from or linked to, the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      By utilizing or interacting with the Services in any way, you represent and warrant that you
      understand the inherent risks associated with: cryptographic systems and blockchain-based
      networks; Digital Assets, including the usage and intricacies of native Digital Assets, like
      DYDX (DYDX); smart contract-based tokens; and systems that interact with blockchain-based
      networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code
      cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which
      may present risks to Digital Assets and the smart contract to which the Services facilitate
      access, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. We are unable to update
      the smart contracts and software to which the Services provide access for any advances in
      cryptography or to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks
      presented from technological advancements; thus, there can be no guarantee regarding the
      security of smart contracts and/or software or protocols to which the Services facilitate
      access.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree and understand that all investment decisions are made solely by you. You agree and
      understand that under no circumstances will the operation of the Services and your use of it
      be deemed to create a relationship that includes the provision of or tendering of investment
      advice. NO FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TAX, LEGAL OR SECURITIES ADVICE IS GIVEN THROUGH OR IN
      CONNECTION WITH OUR SERVICES. No content found on the Services, whether created by us, a third
      party, or another user is or should be considered as investment advice. You agree and
      understand that we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and shall in no circumstances be
      liable in connection with, your decisions or your use of our Services. Nothing contained in
      the Services constitutes a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement, or offer by us or any
      third party to transact in any Digital Assets, securities, or other financial instruments.
      Neither we nor any of our affiliates has endorsed or sponsored any Digital Assets made
      available or that can be transacted through third-party tools available from the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      You understand and accept that, in connection with your use of the Services, you may be
      required to pay fees necessary for interacting with blockchain software, including (without
      limitation) “gas” costs, and you understand that you are solely responsible for paying such
      fees and costs and that none of such fees or costs will be paid to Company or Company’s
      affiliates.
    </p>

    <h2>Taxes and Fraud</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location of residence, you may owe taxes on amounts you earn after
      exchanging assets, including Digital Assets and crypto assets. It is your responsibility to
      ensure you have accounted for, reported to the proper governmental authority, and paid all
      such taxes to the applicable governmental authority. We do not undertake any obligation to
      report any such taxes, nor collect or disburse them on your behalf. The taxes you owe are
      solely your responsibility. You hold us harmless and release us from and against any claims,
      losses, damages or demands arising in connection with taxes you may owe as a result of your
      transactions on the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we believe that you have engaged in or been a participant in any fraudulent transaction, we
      reserve the right to take any action we think appropriate, including forwarding your
      information and information about the transactions we believe or suspect to be fraudulent to
      applicable law enforcement agencies, which may result in civil or criminal penalties or other
      actions against you.

    <h2>Third Party Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Any Indemnified Party not being a party to these Terms of Use may enforce any rights granted
      to it pursuant to these Terms of Use in its own right as if it were a party to these Terms of
      Use. Unless expressly provided to the contrary in these Terms of Use, a person who is not a
      party to these Terms of Use shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third
      Parties) Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands to enforce any term of these Terms of Use.
      Notwithstanding any term of these Terms of Use, the consent of or notice to any person who is

      ANY CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE, CLAIM OR DISAGREEMENT (EACH A “DISPUTE”) ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS 
      OF USE OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE THAT AROSE BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATES OF THESE 
      TERMS OF USE, TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS SECTION EXTENDS TO DISPUTES THAT AROSE 
      OR INVOLVE FACTS OCCURING BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SECTION OR ANY PRIOR VERSIONS OF THESE 
      TERMS OF USE AS WELL AS DISPUTES THAT MAY ARISE AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE.
    </p>

    <p>
      You and Company agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or 
      the Services is personal to you and Company, and that any Dispute will be resolved solely through 
      binding individual arbitration, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or 
      any other type of representative proceeding.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      All matters relating to the Services and these Terms of Use and any Dispute arising
      therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual Disputes),
      shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Cayman Islands
      without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
      Cayman Islands or any other jurisdiction).
    </p>

    <p>
      Any Dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to these
      Terms of Use shall be settled by arbitration administered by the Cayman Islands Mediation
      &amp; Arbitration Centre (CI-MAC) in accordance with the Arbitration Act (as amended) of the
      Cayman Islands. The arbitration shall be seated in George Town, Cayman Islands and shall be
      heard in the English language and determined by a sole arbitrator. Any award or decision made
      by the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties, and
      judgment upon any award thus obtained may be entered in or enforced by any court of competent
      jurisdiction. You shall not institute any action at law or in equity based upon any claim
      arising out of or related to these Terms of Use in any court. We retain the right to bring any 
      suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Use in your country of 
      residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of 
      jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation on Time to File Claims</h2>
    <p>
      Any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use must be brought by you within 12
      months of such claim arising, or your date of knowledge of the facts founding such claim if
      later, and you hereby expressly agree to exclude the effect of the Limitation Act (1996
      Revision) in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to the fullest extent permitted by law that no class or collective action can be
      asserted in relation to these Terms of Use, and that all claims, whether in arbitration or
      otherwise, arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use must be brought by you in your
      individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or
      collective proceeding.
    </p>

    <h2>Waiver and Severability</h2>
    <p>
      No waiver by Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a
      further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or
      condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use
      shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision nor shall it preclude or restrict any
      further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provisions of these Terms of Use shall be severable in the event that any of the
      provisions hereof are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
      otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest
      extent permitted by law and these Terms of Use will be construed in all respects as if such
      invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision as
      similar as possible to the one replaced.
    </p>
